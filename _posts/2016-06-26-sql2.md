* SELECT is the clause you use every time you want to query information from a database.
* WHERE is a popular command that lets you filter the results of the query based on conditions that you specify.
* LIKE and BETWEEN are special operators that can be used in a WHERE clause
* AND and OR are special operators that you can use with WHERE to filter the query on two or more conditions.
* ORDER BY lets you sort the results of the query in either ascending or descending order.
* LIMIT lets you specify the maximum number of rows that the query will return. This is especially important in large tables that have thousands or even millions of rows.

今天是毕业生在校最后一天，毕业典礼。又离开一届，很快就轮到我这个老人了。

晚上吃了五道口的唐西炸鸡，喝一瓶福佳，英国脱欧跟我有什么关系，哼。回宿舍看游戏好时光直播！#墨镜#

好想去上海。不喜欢北京。
